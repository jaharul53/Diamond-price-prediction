# Diamond-price-prediction
This project aims to predict diamond prices using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. Two types of regression models have been implemented: Linear Regression for continuous price prediction and Logistic Regression for classification tasks related to diamond characteristics.


Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.


Models
Linear Regression: Used to predict the continuous variable, which is the price of the diamonds.
Logistic Regression: Used for classification tasks related to diamond features.
